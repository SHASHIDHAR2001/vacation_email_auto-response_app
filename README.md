# vacation_email_auto-response_app

App that would need to build:

write a Node.js based app that is able to respond to emails sent to your Gmail mailbox while you're out on a vacation,

What should the app do?

  ##  The app should check for new emails in a given Gmail ID
  ##  You need to implement the "Login with google" API for this
  ##  the app should send replies to Emails that have no prior replies
  ##  The app should identify and isolate the email threads in which no prior email has been sent by you.
  ##  This means that the app should only reply to first time email threads sent by others to your mailbox. 
  ##  The email that you send as a reply can have any content you'd like, it doesn't matter.
  ##  The app should add a Label to the email and move the email to the label

After sending the reply, the email should be tagged with a label to mail. 

Skills:- Node.js, javascript, REST API's.
